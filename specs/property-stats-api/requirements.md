# Feature Requirements Document

## Property Statistics API

### Overview

This feature provides a property statistics API endpoint for the QRent system, allowing clients to retrieve aggregated property data analysis based on specified regions. The API will provide both REST and tRPC interfaces, supporting multi-region queries and returning detailed statistical information for each region.

### Feature Summary

- Region-based property statistics querying
- Key metrics including average room price, commute time, property count, and average property price
- Compatible with existing property API region matching patterns
- Dual REST and tRPC interface support

## User Stories

### Core Functionality

**User Story 1: Regional Statistics Data Query**
As a frontend developer, I want to retrieve property statistics data for specified regions via API, so that I can display regional analysis information in the user interface.

Acceptance Criteria:
```
1.1 When the client sends a request with valid region strings, the system should return statistics data for each region.
1.2 When the client sends empty region parameters, the system should return statistics of all existing regions.
1.3 When the client sends invalid or non-existent regions, the system should indicate no data available for those regions in the results.
1.4 When the client sends multiple regions (space-separated), the system should return independent statistics data for each region.
```

**User Story 2: Average Room Price Calculation**
As a data analyst, I want to get the average price per room for each region, so that I can analyze property value distribution across different areas.

Acceptance Criteria:
```
2.1 When property data exists in a region, the system should return the average price per room (property price / number of bedrooms) for that region.
2.2 When a property has 0 or null bedrooms, the system should exclude that property from the calculation.
2.3 When no valid property data exists in a region, the system should return null or a clear no-data indicator.
2.4 Calculation results should retain appropriate decimal places (recommended 2 decimal places).
```

**User Story 3: Commute Time Statistics**
As a user, I want to understand the average commute time from various regions, so that I can consider transportation convenience when choosing rental properties.

Acceptance Criteria:
```
3.1 When properties in a region contain commute time data, the system should return the average commute time for that region.
3.2 When property commute time data is missing, the system should exclude that property from the calculation.
3.3 Commute time should be returned in minutes.
3.4 When no commute time data exists in a region, the system should return null or a clear no-data indicator.
```

**User Story 4: Property Count and Average Price**
As a market researcher, I want to get the total number of properties and average price for each region, so that I can conduct market analysis.

Acceptance Criteria:
```
4.1 When properties exist in a region, the system should return the total property count for that region.
4.2 When properties exist in a region, the system should return the average property price for that region.
4.3 Average price calculation should be based on valid property price data.
4.4 When no properties exist in a region, count should return 0 and average price should return null.
```

### Edge Cases and Constraints

**User Story 5: Input Validation and Error Handling**
As a system administrator, I want the API to gracefully handle various input exceptions, so that stable service can be provided.

Acceptance Criteria:
```
5.1 When input parameters are missing, the system should return a 400 error with specific error information.
5.2 When input contains special characters, the system should perform appropriate sanitization or validation.
5.3 When database connection fails, the system should return a 500 error with generic error information.
5.4 When queries timeout, the system should return a 504 error.
```

**User Story 6: Performance and Caching**
As a system architect, I want the API to efficiently handle requests, so that high-concurrency access can be supported.

Acceptance Criteria:
```
6.1 Single query response time should be within 2 seconds.
6.2 The system should support appropriate caching mechanisms for statistical data.
6.3 When data is updated, related caches should be properly cleared.
6.4 The API should be able to handle at least 100 concurrent requests.
```

### Technical Constraints

- API must provide both REST and tRPC interfaces
- Region matching patterns must be consistent with existing property APIs
- Database queries must use Prisma ORM
- Response format must comply with existing API specifications
- Must include appropriate error handling and logging
- Must follow QRent project's TypeScript type safety requirements

### Success Criteria

- API successfully handles single-region and multi-region queries
- All statistical data calculations are accurate
- Performance meets response time requirements
- Error handling covers all known exception cases
- Code passes all unit tests and integration tests
- API documentation is complete and accurate

Additional Details:
```
Dependencies: Existing property database schema, Prisma ORM setup, tRPC configuration
Assumptions: Property data includes price, bedroom count, and commute time fields; regions follow existing naming conventions
```
