# Implementation Plan

## Core Feature Development

### 1. Database Service Layer
- [ ] 1.1 Create PropertyStatsService with Prisma-based statistics calculations
        - Objective: Implement service class that uses Prisma ORM to calculate regional property statistics with non-null return values
        - Details: Create `/src/services/PropertyStatsService.ts` with methods for each statistical calculation, ensuring all fields return 0 instead of null when no data exists
        - Requirements Reference: User Stories 1-4 in `requirements.md`, specifically acceptance criteria for statistical calculations
        - Design Reference: PropertyStatsService class definition and statistical calculations section in `design.md`
        - Acceptance: Service calculates avgPricePerRoom, avgCommuteTime, totalProperties, and avgPropertyPrice using Prisma queries, returns 0 for missing data

- [ ] 1.2 Implement region parsing and cache key generation logic
        - Objective: Create methods to parse space-separated region strings and generate consistent cache keys regardless of region order
        - Details: Implement `parseRegions()` method that handles empty/undefined input and `generateCacheKey()` that sorts regions for consistent caching
        - Requirements Reference: User Story 1 acceptance criteria 1.2 and 1.4 in `requirements.md`
        - Design Reference: Cache strategy section in `design.md`, specifically the cache key generation with sorting
        - Acceptance: Method parses regions correctly, handles all regions when input is empty, generates identical cache keys for same regions in different orders

- [ ] 1.3 Implement Redis caching integration
        - Objective: Add caching layer to PropertyStatsService with proper cache hit/miss handling and TTL management
        - Details: Integrate with existing Redis setup, implement cache storage/retrieval with 1-hour TTL and cache invalidation methods
        - Requirements Reference: User Story 6 acceptance criteria for performance and caching in `requirements.md`
        - Design Reference: Caching strategy section in `design.md`, PropertyStatsCacheService implementation
        - Acceptance: Cache stores and retrieves statistics correctly, implements proper TTL, provides cache invalidation functionality

### 2. API Layer Implementation

        - Design Reference: tRPC Router section in `design.md`, input/output schemas and procedure definition
        - Acceptance: tRPC procedure validates region input, calls PropertyStatsService, returns properly formatted response with all required fields

- [ ] 2.2 Create REST controller endpoint
        - Objective: Implement REST controller that provides the same functionality as tRPC procedure for compatibility
        - Details: Create `/src/controllers/PropertyStatsController.ts` with Express route handler that uses PropertyStatsService
        - Requirements Reference: Technical constraints requiring both REST and tRPC interfaces in `requirements.md`
        - Design Reference: REST Controller section in `design.md`, PropertyStatsController class implementation
        - Acceptance: REST endpoint accepts query parameters, validates input, returns JSON response matching tRPC output format

- [ ] 2.3 Register new API endpoints in application routing
        - Objective: Integrate the new property statistics endpoints into the existing tRPC and Express routing configuration
        - Details: Add propertyStatsRouter to tRPC app router and register REST routes in Express app
        - Requirements Reference: Technical constraints for API integration in `requirements.md`
        - Design Reference: API Registration section in `design.md`, router and route registration examples
        - Acceptance: Both tRPC and REST endpoints are accessible, integrated properly with existing authentication middleware

### 3. Data Models and Validation
- [ ] 3.1 Create TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas
        - Objective: Define type-safe interfaces for request/response data and validation schemas for input parameters
        - Details: Create interfaces for RegionStats and PropertyStatsResponse, implement Zod schemas for input validation
        - Requirements Reference: User Story 5 acceptance criteria for input validation in `requirements.md`
        - Design Reference: Components and Interfaces section and Data Models section in `design.md`
        - Acceptance: All data structures are properly typed, input validation prevents invalid region strings, response format is consistent

- [ ] 3.2 Implement comprehensive error handling
        - Objective: Create error handling that covers all specified error scenarios with appropriate HTTP status codes and messages
        - Details: Implement validation errors (400), database errors (500), timeout errors (504) with structured error responses
        - Requirements Reference: User Story 5 acceptance criteria for error handling in `requirements.md`
        - Design Reference: Error Handling section in `design.md`, error types and response formats
        - Acceptance: All error types return appropriate status codes and messages, errors are logged properly for debugging

### 4. Testing Implementation
- [ ] 4.1 Write unit tests for PropertyStatsService
